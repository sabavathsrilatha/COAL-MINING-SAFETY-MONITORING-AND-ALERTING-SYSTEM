# Coal Mining Safety Monitoring and Alerting System

## Overview

The Coal Mining Safety Monitoring and Alerting System is designed to enhance the safety of workers in coal mines by continuously monitoring environmental parameters and providing real-time alerts in case of hazardous conditions. The system utilizes various sensors to detect gas levels, temperature, humidity, and other critical factors, ensuring prompt responses to potential dangers.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously tracks environmental conditions in the mine.
- **Alert System:** Provides immediate alerts through alarms, lights, or messages when dangerous conditions are detected.
- **Data Logging:** Records sensor data for analysis and future reference.
- **User Interface:** A dashboard for visualizing sensor data and system status.
- **Scalability:** Can be expanded with additional sensors and features.

## Technologies Used

- **Hardware:** Arduino/Raspberry Pi, various sensors (gas, temperature, humidity, etc.)
- **Programming Languages:** Python, C++
- **Database:** MySQL/PostgreSQL for data storage
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the dashboard interface
- **Backend:** Flask/Django for the web server
- **Communication Protocols:** MQTT, HTTP

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.x recommended)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (if using Arduino)
- [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) (if using Raspberry Pi)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coal-mining-safety-system.git
   cd coal-mining-safety-system
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the database:**
   - Configure your database settings in `config.py`.
   - Initialize the database:
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

4. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

5. **Install frontend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

6. **Build and run the frontend:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. **Deploy the hardware setup:** Install the sensors in the mining area and connect them to the microcontroller (Arduino/Raspberry Pi).

2. **Configure the sensors:** Set up the sensor parameters and thresholds in the system's dashboard.

3. **Monitor the dashboard:** Use the web-based dashboard to monitor real-time data and receive alerts.

4. **Data Analysis:** Use the logged data for analysis and improve safety protocols.
